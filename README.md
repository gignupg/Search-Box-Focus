You hate taking your hand off the keyboard all the time only to access the search bar of the website you're visiting?

You'd love to simply press tab or a custom shortcut to focus the search field and start typing right away without ever using your mouse?

"Search Box Focus" solves exactly these problems. It also comes with an "Autofocus" feature which allows you to access the search bar automatically without even the need to press tab or another shortcut. Simply activate it on those websites where you do a lot of searching. Whenever you load a website that has "Autofocus" enabled or when you switch to it from another tab, you'll find that the cursor is already in the search bar ready for you to start typing. 

The extension is completely open source which means, no tracking or data collection. No ads! 

Feel free to suggest new features, report bugs and so on right here on Github.
